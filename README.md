# The Data Blueprint

A static tech blog about **data architecture, data engineering and AI engineering**,
built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on **GitHub Pages**.

Live URL (once Pages is enabled): **https://subhtech09.github.io/techblogging/**

- Brick-red and deep-green palette with automatic light and dark mode
- Articles are Markdown files; architecture diagrams are plain `.jpg` files
- Click-to-enlarge diagram viewer (fit to screen, actual size, drag to pan)
- Auto-generated table of contents, reading progress bar, code copy buttons
- Topic pages, tags, client-side full-text search, RSS feed, sitemap, SEO and social cards
- No build step on your side — GitHub builds the site on every push

---

## 1. Publish the site (one-time setup)

1. Push this folder to `https://github.com/subhtech09/techblogging` (branch `main`).
2. On GitHub open **Settings → Pages**.
3. Under **Build and deployment**, choose **Source: Deploy from a branch**,
   then **Branch: `main`** and folder **`/ (root)`**, and click **Save**.
4. Wait 1–2 minutes. The **Actions** tab shows the "pages build and deployment"
   run; when it is green the site is live.

From then on, every `git push` to `main` rebuilds and republishes the site.

> **Different URL?** `_config.yml` contains `url` and `baseurl`. If you rename the
> repository to `subhtech09.github.io` or add a custom domain, set `baseurl: ""`
> and update `url`.

## 2. Write a new article

### Option A — helper script (Windows)

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\new-post.ps1 -Title "Streaming joins in practice" -Topic data-engineering
```

This creates `_posts/2026-10-09-streaming-joins-in-practice.md` from the
template and an empty diagram folder `assets/images/posts/streaming-joins-in-practice/`.

### Option B — by hand

1. Copy `_templates/post.md` to `_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-your-slug.md`.
2. Create the folder `assets/images/posts/your-slug/` for its diagrams.

The **slug** is the part of the file name after the date. It becomes the URL
(`/blog/your-slug/`) and the name of the diagram folder.

### Front matter

```yaml
---
title: "Designing a Lakehouse with the Medallion Architecture"
description: "One or two sentences — shown under the title, on cards, in search and social previews."
category: data-architecture        # data-architecture | data-engineering | ai-engineering
tags: [lakehouse, medallion]
image: /assets/images/posts/your-slug/main-diagram.jpg   # optional: card thumbnail + social preview
featured: true                     # optional: show in "Start here" on the home page
last_modified_at: 2026-11-01       # optional: shows "Updated …"
toc: false                         # optional: hide the table of contents
---
```

Posts dated in the future are not published until that date (after the next push or rebuild).

---

## 3. Add architecture diagrams

1. Save the diagram as a `.jpg` in `assets/images/posts/<your-slug>/`.
2. Put this line where the diagram should appear, **on its own line with a blank
   line above and below**:

```liquid
{% include figure.html src="ingestion-flow.jpg" alt="What the diagram shows, for screen readers" caption="**Figure 1.** Ingestion flow from CDC to the bronze layer." %}
```

- `src` — just the file name; it is looked up in that post's folder.
  To reuse an image from elsewhere, give a full path such as `/assets/images/shared/legend.jpg`.
- `alt` — a short description of the diagram (important for accessibility).
- `caption` — optional, supports Markdown such as `**bold**`.

Readers can click any diagram to open it full-screen, switch to actual size and drag to pan.

**Tips for diagram files**

- Export at about **1600–2400 px wide**. That stays sharp on high-resolution
  screens and in the zoom view.
- Keep each file **under ~500 KB** (JPG quality 80–90 is plenty). GitHub Pages
  sites have a 1 GB limit and pages load faster with smaller images.
- Use lowercase file names with hyphens, e.g. `rag-query-path.jpg`. GitHub Pages
  is **case-sensitive**: `Diagram.JPG` and `diagram.jpg` are different files.

## 4. Formatting cheat sheet

| You write | You get |
|---|---|
| `## Heading` / `### Sub-heading` | Section headings and table-of-contents entries |
| ```` ```sql ```` … ```` ``` ```` | Syntax-highlighted code with a copy button (`python`, `sql`, `yaml`, `bash`, `scala`, `json`, …) |
| `> Text` then `{: .note }` on the next line | Grey "Note" callout |
| `> Text` then `{: .tip }` | Green "Tip" callout |
| `> Text` then `{: .warning }` | Red "Watch out" callout |
| Markdown table | Styled table that scrolls sideways on phones |
| `[link]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2026-09-28-idempotent-pipelines %})` | Link to another post that never breaks |

---

## 5. Preview locally (optional)

You can skip this and preview on GitHub after pushing. To preview on your own
machine first:

1. Install Ruby **with Devkit** from <https://rubyinstaller.org/> (Ruby 3.3 recommended)
   and let it run `ridk install` at the end.
2. In this folder:

   ```powershell
   gem install bundler
   bundle install
   bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
   ```

3. Open <http://localhost:4000/techblogging/>.

`bundle install` uses the `github-pages` gem, so the local build uses the same
Jekyll and plugin versions as GitHub.

**Alternative with Docker/Podman** (no Ruby install):

```powershell
podman run --rm -it -p 4000:4000 -v "${PWD}:/srv" -w /srv ruby:3.3 bash -c "bundle install && bundle exec jekyll serve --host 0.0.0.0"
```

## 6. Customise

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Blog name, tagline, description, URL | `_config.yml` |
| Your name, role, bio, avatar, social links | `_data/authors.yml` |
| Header menu | `_data/navigation.yml` |
| Topics (names, descriptions, icons) | `_data/topics.yml`, plus one page per topic in `topics/` |
| Home page headline | front matter of `index.html` |
| About page | `about.md` |
| Colours and fonts | top of `assets/css/main.css` (`--brick-*`, `--green-*`, `--oat-*`) |
| Social preview image | `assets/images/og-default.jpg`; regenerate with `tools\make-og-image.ps1 -Title "..."` |

**Adding a topic:** add an entry to `_data/topics.yml`, copy one of the files in
`topics/`, change `topic:`, `title:` and `permalink:`, and add it to
`_data/navigation.yml` if it should appear in the header.

### Comments (optional)

Comments use [giscus](https://giscus.app), which stores them in GitHub Discussions:

1. In the repo settings enable **Discussions**.
2. Install the giscus app: <https://github.com/apps/giscus>.
3. Fill in the form at <https://giscus.app> to get `repo_id` and `category_id`.
4. Copy them into the `giscus:` block in `_config.yml` and set `enabled: true`.

## 7. How this fits GitHub Pages' limits

| GitHub Pages limitation | How the site handles it |
|---|---|
| Static files only, no server code | Everything is pre-rendered HTML; search, filters and the diagram viewer run in the browser |
| Only [whitelisted plugins](https://pages.github.com/versions/) | Uses only `jekyll-feed`, `jekyll-seo-tag` and `jekyll-sitemap`; topic and tag pages use plain Liquid |
| No database | Search reads `search.json`, which is generated at build time |
| No comment backend | Optional giscus comments stored in GitHub Discussions |
| 1 GB site size, 100 GB/month soft bandwidth | Plain CSS/JS with no frameworks; keep diagrams under ~500 KB |
| Pages cached for ~10 minutes | CSS/JS URLs carry a build timestamp, so readers get new styles after each deploy |
