Opening paragraph — what problem this article solves and who it is for. The
first paragraph is styled slightly larger as a lead-in.

## First section

Body text. Use `##` for sections and `###` for sub-sections — they build the
"On this page" table of contents automatically.

{% include figure.html src="architecture.jpg" alt="Describe what the diagram shows" caption="**Figure 1.** A short caption explaining the diagram." %}

### A sub-section

> Use callouts for asides. Change `.note` to `.tip` or `.warning`.
{: .note }

```python
# Fenced code blocks get syntax highlighting and a copy button.
def hello(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}"
```

| Column | Another column |

| Tables | are styled and scroll on small screens |
